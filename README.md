# Calculus With Python: Derivatives and Integrals

Welcome to the **Calculus With Python** project by [Mike X Cohen](https://www.sincxpress.com)!

This repository contains all the code used in two companion Udemy courses on calculus:

- [Calculus 1: Derivatives](https://sincxpress.thinkific.com/products/courses/calc1)
- [Calculus 2: Integrals](https://sincxpress.thinkific.com/products/courses/calc2)

Both courses combine traditional mathematical instruction with hands-on coding in Python. The idea is simple: **you can learn a lot of math with a bit of code.** By using Python (especially `numpy`, `sympy`, and `matplotlib`), you'll build visualizations, test ideas, and implement core concepts from calculus.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into two main folders:

### [`calculus1_derivatives/`](./calculus1_derivatives/)
This folder contains all Python code for the *Calculus 1: Derivatives* course. Topics include:

- Python introduction
- Functions
- Limits and the definition of the derivative
- Rules of differentiation (chain, product, quotient)
- Higher-order derivatives
- Symbolic and numeric differentiation using Python

### [`calculus2_integrals/`](./calculus2_integrals/)
This folder contains all Python code for the *Calculus 2: Integrals* course. Topics include:

- Indefinite and definite integrals
- Fundamental theorem of calculus
- Riemann and Lebesgue integration
- Symbolic and numerical integration
- Applications to area, volume, and probability
- Multivariable integration and partial integrals

## About the Courses

These courses are for learners who want to go beyond memorizing formulas â€” and instead **understand calculus by actively exploring it** through programming. Whether you're a university student, a data scientist brushing up on math, or a lifelong learner, you'll find something here to sharpen your intuition and build practical skills.

All code is written in Python 3 and designed to be easy to follow, modify, and extend. The code is designed to be run in Python Jupyter notebooks, and I recommend running it on Google Colab.
