# Master calculus 1 using Python: derivatives and applications

Welcome to the official code repository for the [Calculus 1: Derivatives](https://sincxpress.thinkific.com/products/courses/calc1) course on my self-hosted site, created by [Mike X Cohen](https://www.sincxpress.com).

This repository contains all the Python code used in the course, including:

- Code demonstrations that accompany each video
- Exercise solutions (fully explained in the videos)
- Additional resources and visuals to support your learning

> The goal of this course (and this repo) is to help you *learn calculus by doing calculus* â€” and Python is your tool for exploring, visualizing, and deeply understanding derivative concepts.

The course covers the following major topics:

- Functions
- Limits
- Differentiation rules and theorems
- Applications
- Multivariable differentiation
- Python introduction

---

## Getting Started

To run the code, you'll need Python (3.7 or newer) and the following Python libraries:

- numpy
- matplotlib
- sympy
- scipy

However, I recommend following along with the course using  [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/). It has all the Python libraries already installed, so you can just immediately start coding. If you want to run the code locally on your computer, I recommend installing Jupyter notebooks via Anaconda.

Recommendation: Download the code in this repo (or clone it), upload it to your Google Drive, then open the files in Colab while following along with the videos.

***New to Python?*** No worries, just start with the 7-hour _Python Introduction_ in the appendix of the course.

## Repository Structure

- Each folder in this repo corresponds to a section of the course
- The filenames within each folder are ```<course>_<section>_<video>.ipynb```

---

## How to Use This Repository

- Follow along with the course on Udemy
- Use the code to experiment with concepts: try modifying equations, creating new plots, or implementing your own problems
- Use the exercise solutions (in the "code challenge" videos) to check your understanding or troubleshoot your own solutions

### Happy differentiating!
